description: 'Data from the EU-funded ''Strengthening Financial Resilience and Accelerating
  Risk Reduction in Central Asia'' Program. (https://www.gfdrr.org/en/program/SFRARR-Central-Asia).

  Exposure data developed using high-resolution global and regional datasets and local
  official data, harmonized to produce a regionally-consistent exposure database for
  Central Asia. The exposure database includes: population, residential buildings,
  non-residential buildings (schools, healthcare facilities, industrial and commercial
  buildings), croplands, transportation system (roads, railways and bridges), airports
  and airstrips, mines, and supply infrastructure. The exposure database developed
  during this project can be used at regional scale, national scale or sub-national
  scale (e.g., at Oblast scale). '

purpose: Regional risk modelling. These data have been derived on a regional scale
  for the purpose of consistent regional multi-country hazard and risk assessment.
  Application of this information on smaller scales should be done with care. Importantly
  on a local scale, it is often the case that more detailed history and hazard information
  is required to perform such hazard and risk modelling, particularly were applied
