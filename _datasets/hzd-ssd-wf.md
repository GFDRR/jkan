purpose: >-
  The results of the analysis contribute to the production of knowledge for
  disaster risk management (DRM) to support the World Bankâ€™s operational teams
  in their in-country engagements. Specifcally, the key fndings of this study
  allow to rank South Sudan states in terms of natural disasters risk, and to
  identify the most critical components for each area. The output of this
  assessment includes a geodatabase which contains both the key primary data and
  all the resulting maps produced by the analysis, allowing risk analysts and
  managers to explore them in detail using GIS software.
