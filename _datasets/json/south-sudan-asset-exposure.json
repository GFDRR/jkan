Specifcally, the key fndings of this study allow to rank South Sudan states in terms of natural disasters risk, and to identify the most critical components for each area. The output of this assessment includes a geodatabase which contains both the key primary data and all the resulting maps produced by the analysis, allowing risk analysts and managers to explore them in detail using GIS software.",

This publication describes the applied methods and main results of the project.",
