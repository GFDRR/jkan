The exposure database includes: population, residential buildings, non-residential buildings (schools, healthcare facilities, industrial and commercial buildings), croplands, transportation system (roads, railways and bridges), airports and airstrips, mines, and supply infrastructure. The exposure database developed during this project can be used at regional scale, national scale or sub-national scale (e.g., at Oblast scale).",
