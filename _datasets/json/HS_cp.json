      "description": "The final output dataset includes historical and future estimates of WBGT in the shade and in the sun for ~15,300 cities and ~24,000 climatically-similar regions around the world. The full analysis includes 26 global climate models (GCMs) and one emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5). To support different use cases, we've made the results available at a few different levels of granularity and in two different formats.",
