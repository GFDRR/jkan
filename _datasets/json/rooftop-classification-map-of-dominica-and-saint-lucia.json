The categories for roof type are FLAT, GABLE, HIP, and NO ROOF, and the categories for roof material are HEALTHY METAL, IRREGULAR METAL, CONCRETE/CEMENT, BLUE TARPAULIN, and INCOMPLETE. The roof classification map was derived using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on ~15,000 labels across Dominica and Saint Lucia. The roof type and roof classification maps were predicted from nationwide very high-resolution RGB orthophotos with a spatial resolution of 20 cm/px taken in 2018-2019, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017. The dataset also contains the predicted probabilities per category, suffixed by \\\"_PROB\\\". ",

In this work, we leverage deep learning techniques for the automated classification of roof characteristics from very high-resolution orthophotos and airborne LiDAR data obtained in Dominica following Hurricane Maria in 2017. We demonstrate that the fusion of multimodal earth observation data performs better than using any single data source alone. Using our proposed methods, we achieve F1 scores of 0.93 and 0.92 for roof type and roof material classification, respectively. This work is intended to help governments produce more timely building information to improve resilience and disaster response in the Caribbean.",
