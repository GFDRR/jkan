purpose: Regional risk modelling. These data have been derived on a regional scale
  for the purpose of consistent regional multi-country hazard and risk assessment.
  Application of this information on smaller scales should be done with care. Importantly
  on a local scale, it is often the case that more detailed history and hazard information
  is required to perform such hazard and risk modelling, particularly were applied
  to dimension mitigation structures or strategies., it is often the case that more
