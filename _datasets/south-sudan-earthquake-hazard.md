purpose: "The results of the analysis contribute to the production of knowledge for\
  \ disaster risk management (DRM) to support the World Bank\u2019s operational teams\
  \ in their in-country engagements. Specifcally, the key fndings of this study allow\
  \ to rank South Sudan states in terms of natural disasters risk, and to identify\
  \ the most critical components for each area. The output of this assessment includes\
  \ a geodatabase which contains both the key primary data and all the resulting maps\
  \ produced by the analysis, allowing risk analysts and managers to explore them\
  \ in detail using GIS software."
