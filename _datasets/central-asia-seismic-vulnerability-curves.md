purpose: Regional risk modelling. These data have been derived on a regional scale
  for the purpose of consistent regional multi-country hazard and risk assessment.
  Application of this information on smaller scales should be done with care. Importantly
  on a local scale, it is often the case that more detailed history and hazard information
  is required to perform such hazard and risk modelling, particularly were applied
  to dimension mitigation structures or strategies., it is often the case that more

  description: This file (available as JSON via API) contains four sheets named "Residential",
    "Non-residential", "Infrastructure" and "Human Loss". In each sheet column A defines
    the IM values in terms of PGA [g] and the vulnerability class is defined in the
    first row. The rest of the columns define the Mean Loss Ratio (Mean LR) and Coefficient
    of variation (only for Residential and NonResidential).
