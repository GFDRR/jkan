description: The final output dataset includes historical and future estimates of
  WBGT in the shade and in the sun for ~15,300 cities and ~24,000 climatically-similar
  regions around the world. The full analysis includes 26 global climate models (GCMs)
  and one emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5). To support different use cases, we've made
  the results available at a few different levels of granularity and in two different
  formats.
