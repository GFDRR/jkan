    time and 6 hours duration, i.e., a map for each return time where each pixel represents
    the maximum water depth. In order to derive the hazard maps over the entire domain,
    for each return period an hydraulic simulation is performed for each simulation
    unit domain feeding the model with the Intensity Duration Frequency curve at 6
    hours
