description: "The World Settlement Footprint (WSF\xAE) 2019 is a 10m resolution binary\
  \ mask outlining the extent of human settlements globally derived by means of 2019\
  \ multitemporal Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery."
details: "Based on the hypothesis that settlements generally show a more stable behavior\
  \ with respect to most land-cover classes, temporal statistics are calculated for\
  \ both S1- and S2-based indices. In particular, a comprehensive analysis has been\
  \ performed by exploiting a number of reference building outlines to identify the\
  \ most suitable set of temporal features (ultimately including 6 from S1 and 25\
  \ from S2). Training points for the settlement and non-settlement class are then\
  \ generated by thresholding specific features, which varies depending on the 30\
  \ climate types of the well-established K\xF6ppen Geiger scheme. Next, binary classification\
  \ based on Random Forest is applied and, finally, a dedicated post-processing is\
  \ performed where ancillary datasets are employed to further reduce omission and\
  \ commission errors. Here, the whole classification process has been entirely carried\
  \ out within the Google Earth Engine platform. To assess the high accuracy and reliability\
  \ of the WSF2019, two independent crowd-sourcing-based validation exercises have\
  \ been carried out with the support of Google and Mapswipe, respectively, where\
  \ overall 1M reference labels have been collected based photointerpretation of very\
  \ high-resolution optical imagery."
