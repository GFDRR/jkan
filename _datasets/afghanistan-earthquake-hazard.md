description: Earthquake hazard map representing Peak ground acceleration (PGA-g) for
  seven return period scenarios.
details: "To better understand natural hazard and disaster risk, the World Bank and\
  \ Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) supported the development\
  \ of new \uFB02uvial \uFB02ood, \uFB02ash \uFB02ood, drought, landslide, avalanche\
  \ and seismic risk information in Afghanistan, as well as a frst-order analysis\
  \ of the costs and benefts of resilient reconstruction and risk reduction strategies.\
  \ This publication describes the applied methods and main results of the project."

purpose: These maps have been derived on a nation-wide scale for the purpose of identifying
  high risk- areas on the district and provincial scale, from which decisions can
  be made on allocating efforts for more detailed site specific hazard and risk analysis.
  Use of this information on smaller scales should be applied with care. Importantly
  for on a local scale, it is often the case that more detailed case history and hazard
  information is required to perform such hazard and risk modelling, particularly
  where applied to dimension mitigation structures or strategies.
