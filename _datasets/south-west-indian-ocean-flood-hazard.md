details: This data set was produced with financial support from the European Union
  in the framework of the ACP-EU Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Program, managed
  by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR).

purpose: 'The goal of the South West Indian Ocean Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative
  (SWIO RAFI) is to improve the resiliency and capacity of the island states through
  the creation of disaster risk financing strategies. A key component of this effort
  involves the quantification of site specific risk from the perils of flood, earthquakes,
  and tropical cyclones as well as their secondary hazards of storm surge and tsunamis.

  Regional hazard intensity calculations were applied to 10,000 years of Stochastic
  catalogs derived from the historical records to produce hazard intensity profiles
  at mean return periods of 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 years. All datasets are
  at their original resolution (0.00083) except for Madagascar (0.0032) which was
  resampled to reduce file sizes.'
