  These maps have been derived on a nation-wide scale for the purpose of
  identifying high-risk areas on the district and provincial scale, from which
  decisions can be made on allocating efforts for more detailed site specific
  hazard and risk analysis. Use of this information on smaller scales should be
  applied with care. Importantly for on a local scale, it is often the case that
  more detailed case history and hazard information is required to perform such
  hazard and risk modelling, particularly where applied to dimension mitigation
  structures or strategies.
