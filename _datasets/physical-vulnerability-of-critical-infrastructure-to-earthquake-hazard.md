description: The Physical Vulnerability Database for Critical Infrastructure Hazard
  Risk Assements is a database that contains fragility and vulnerability curves that
  can be used to evaluate the expected or potential damages to infrastructure assets
  due to flooding, earthquakes, windstorms and landslides.
details: "The database consists of three Excel-spreadsheets:\n\n - Table_D1_Summary_CI_Vulnerability_Data:\
  \ summary table with information on hazard, exposure, and vulnerability characteristics\
  \ as well as a number of details regarding reliability and reference purposes.\n\
  \ - Table_D2_Hazard_Fragility_and_Vulnerability Curves: collection of fragility\
  \ and vulnerability curves\n - Table_D3_Costs: cost values that can be used in combination\
  \ with the curves for the estimation of asset damages"
